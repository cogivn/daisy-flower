## Ways to Contribute

### Share Success Stories

The most valuable contribution. If SDLC 6.1.0 concepts helped your project:

1. Create a **Success Story Issue** using the [template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/success-story.md)
2. Share your results: time saved, quality improved, patterns created
3. Get featured in the case study library

### Improve Documentation

Found a typo? Have a clearer explanation? Want to add an example?

- **Small fixes**: Open a Pull Request directly
- **Large changes**: Open an Issue first to discuss the approach

### Share Patterns and Templates

Created a reusable pattern following the SDLC framework?

1. Document it using the pattern format from [Crisis to Pattern](03-playbooks/crisis-to-pattern.md)
2. Test it on at least 2 use cases
3. Submit via Pull Request to `04-templates/`

### Report Issues

1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Create a new issue with a clear title, description, and suggestions
